## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Batch insert mode via `StandardAudit.batch { }` for high-volume audit logging
- `StandardAudit::CleanupJob` for automated retention enforcement
- `config.use_preset(:standard_id)` to subscribe to StandardId auth events in one call
- GIN index on metadata JSONB column in install generator (PostgreSQL)
- CI-driven gem publishing via GitHub Actions trusted publisher

### Changed

- Migration template uses `jsonb` instead of `json` for metadata column
- Expanded default `sensitive_keys` to include `api_key`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `private_key`, `certificate_chain`, `ssn`, `credit_card`, `authorization`

### Breaking Changes

- AuditLog records are now immutable — `update`/`destroy` raises `ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord`. Use `update_columns` for privileged operations like GDPR anonymization. `delete`/`delete_all` still work for bulk cleanup.
- Removed `auto_cleanup` config attribute. Schedule `StandardAudit::CleanupJob` directly instead.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Core audit log model with UUID primary keys and GlobalID-based polymorphic references
- Convenience API: `StandardAudit.record` with sync, async, and block forms
- ActiveSupport::Notifications subscriber for automatic event capture
- Configurable Current attribute resolvers for request context
- Multi-tenancy support via scope column
- 20+ composable query scopes (by actor, target, scope, event type, time, request context)
- Async processing via ActiveJob with configurable queue
- Sensitive key filtering for metadata
- GDPR compliance: `anonymize_actor!` (right to erasure) and `export_for_actor` (right to access)
- Model concerns: `Auditable` for actors/targets, `AuditScope` for tenant models
- Install generator with migration and initializer templates
- Rake tasks for cleanup, archival, statistics, and GDPR operations
